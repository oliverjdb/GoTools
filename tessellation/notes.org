* Testing
- [X] Test 1D function with a plain interval
- [X] Test 1D function with a real spline curve
* distribute_points_1D
- [ ] replace brute force implementation when computing the objective function
* distribute_points_2D
- [ ] implement brute force version
- [ ] implement efficient version
* triangulate_points_2D
- [ ] implement
* Introduce use of sparse matrices
* Questions
- why does it matter that points are sorted according to size in the update function?
- why does the second update function not perform better?
